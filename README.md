Hey there, 

My name is  Jan and this is an amateaur guide to get you into software programming a.k.a. Coding . To start us off , here are a couple of videos to  psyche you up :

[The art of coding](https://youtu.be/GqgTwkTP6PM)

Now that you are psyched up you need a place to write your code. Ideally you can start writing code on sandbox websites until you get used to syntax. Sandbox websites are mostly like an e learning platform and you can learn from them as you write code the following are my faves and they are absolutely free  :

 [Free code camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
 
 [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

If you choose the route of coding on your computer locally you or you have gotten used to the syntax above. I would advise you to use a linux operating system because one,  it is free and two is very safe . You can use ubuntu or MacOS but if you  have windows and are still not ready to part with your games worry not.  The integrated development environment (IDE ) I recommend for beginners is Visual Studio Code and they have a tutorial on installing it for all operating systems 

 [Setting up VS code on all operating systems](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)

Now that you have set up your coding environment,  you need to watch as many tutorials on youtube about plugins and shortcuts on the IDE , those can be found on youtube and they are amazing 

Now to start up coding you need HTML to create the skeleton of the website, CSS to style your website, bootstrap to style up your website even more and javascript to help you flesh out the website and make it more interactive to the user. I suggest you start with HTML, then CSS , then Bootstrap then JavaScript .

I also advise you to take more classes on [Free code camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) &[codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)  to get used to the syntax and understand the programming environment. Once you are done with these, you are no longer a beginner and you can look into other programming languages such as python , java, C# etc. Also  Javascript libraries such as ReactJS and jQuery or JavaScript frameworks such as VUE &  ANGULAR. The sea is wide and full for all so cast your net where you like. 

Also join communities on twitter and meet up to stay motivated and connected to your fellow programmers .  Also contribute to open source software by opening a github account and pushing projects . Github is also an awesome space to showcase your progress and projects [GIT AND GITHUB CRASH COURSE FOR BEGINNERS](https://youtu.be/SWYqp7iY_Tc) . You can also participate in the twitter challenge #100daysofcode . When you get stuck check out [STACK OVERFLOW](https://stackoverflow.com/)for help. 

Welcome to the tech life and Happy coding 

Kind Regards ,
